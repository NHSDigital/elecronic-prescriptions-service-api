    ## Overview
    Use this API to access the [Electronic Prescription Service (EPS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/electronic-prescription-service) - the national service used to send electronic prescriptions from GP surgeries to pharmacies.

    You can:
    * prepare a secondary care (outpatient) prescription for signing
    * create a secondary care (outpatient) prescription
    * evaluate prescription signing client implementations

    You cannot currently use this API to:
    * prepare a primary care prescription for signing
    * create a primary care prescription
    * prepare a secondary care (other than outpatient) prescription for signing
    * create a secondary care (other than outpatient) prescription
    * prepare a tertiary care prescription for signing
    * create a tertiary care prescription
    * cancel a prescription
    * check the status of a prescription
    * release a prescription for dispensing
    * claim for a dispensed prescription
    * Track prescriptions or check a prescriptions status

    Currently, this API can only be accessed by healthcare professionals, authenticated with an NHS smartcard or equivalent.
    
    Please use the following values for courseOfTherapyType depending on the submitted prescription type:
    * acute => acute
    * repeat => continuous
    * repeat-dispensing => continuous-repeat-dispensing

    ## Using this API
    Electronic prescription messages are digitally signed to protect against tampering and to prevent repudiation. While the messages themselves are FHIR-based, for reasons of backwards compatibility, the signatures must be represented in HL7 V3 format. To make this easier, you can POST a prescription to the `/$prepare` endpoint to receive exactly the HL7 V3 fragments which need to be signed to conform to the specification.
    
    To create a prescription:
    1. POST a prescription in FHIR format to the `/$prepare` endpoint
    2. Sign the response and put the result in a Provenance resource in the original FHIR prescription
    3. POST the signed prescription in FHIR format to the `/$process-message` endpoint

    ### Digital signatures
    To generate a signature for your prescription, you can use the digital signature service. In order to access the service, you can email your request to the [API management team](api.management@nhs.net). Alternatively, for testing purposes, you can use the example signature from the Provenance schema [here](./types/Provenance).

    ## Legal Use
    This API can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so. You should make an access request before you go too far with your development.

    You must have made this request before you can go live (see ‘Onboarding’ below).
    
    ## Related APIs
    The following APIs also give access to the Electronic Prescription Service:
    - [Electronic Prescription Service (HL7 V3) API](https://data.developer.nhs.uk/dms/mim/4.2.00/Index.htm) - use this if you want to use functions that are not yet available on the FHIR API
    - [Prescription Tracker API](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/eps-tracker) - use this if you want a read-only interface to obtain information about a patient’s prescriptions

    ## API status and roadmap
    All endpoints are in [alpha](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#api-status) - expect further breaking changes.
    
    The API is currently available for sandbox testing and integration testing, but not for production use.

    The following items are on our roadmap, in rough priority order:
    * A service to allow the generation of digital signatures
    * Cancellation
    * Primary care prescribing
    * Dispensing
    * Prescription tracking
    * Other prescribing scenarios

    We are extremely keen to receive feedback on the API during alpha and beta,
    for example if there are data fields missing that you think you need.
    [Get in touch](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support) with any comments or suggestions.

    ## Technology
    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#basic-rest).

    It also conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir) global standard for health care data exchange.
    Specifically, it is aligned with [FHIR UK Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core), which is built on FHIR Release 4.

    You don’t need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules.
    In particular:
    - array names are singular, for example `line` not `lines` for address lines
    - data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an `extension` object

    ## Network access
    
    This API is available on the Internet, although access using NHS smartcards (see below)
    currently requires a connection to the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).
    
    For more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).

    ## Authorisation
    This API is [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis),
    meaning an end user must be present and authenticated to use it.

    The end user must be:
    - a healthcare professional
    - strongly authenticated, using either an NHS smartcard or a modern alternative

    The API uses Open ID Connect to authenticate the end user and OAuth 2.0 to authorise the calling system.
    It supports the following security patterns:
    * user-restricted RESTful API - using NHS Identity - combined authentication and authorisation
    * user-restricted RESTful API - using NHS Identity - separate authentication and authorisation

    For more details, see [user-restricted APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis).

    | -------------     | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Sandbox           | `https://sandbox.api.service.nhs.uk/electronic-prescription-service`       |
    | Integration test  | `https://int.api.service.nhs.uk/electronic-prescription-service`           |
    | Production        | `https://api.service.nhs.uk/electronic-prescription-service`               |

    You can test this API in:
    * our [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing) for initial developer testing
    * our [integration test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing) for formal integration testing

    Our sandbox environment is a very basic simulation of the live service. It only covers a limited set of scenarios and is stateless, so does not actually persist any updates.

    For more details on sandbox testing, or to try out the sandbox using our "Try this API" feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.

    ## Onboarding
    We are hoping to make the assurance process as lightweight and as self-service as possible.

    More details to follow.
