    ## Overview
    <style>.codeinline.example {word-wrap: anywhere;}</style>
    Use this API to access the [Electronic Prescription Service (EPS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/electronic-prescription-service) - the national service used to send electronic prescription messages between prescribers and community dispensers.

    ### As a prescriber
    You can:
    * create a primary care prescription
    * cancel a primary care prescription
    * create a secondary care (outpatient) prescription
    * cancel a secondary care (outpatient) prescription
    * create a secondary care (homecare) prescription
    * cancel a secondary care (homecare) prescription
    * view a prescription's summary information

    You cannot currently use this API to:
    * create a tertiary care (homecare) prescription
    * cancel a tertiary care (homecare) prescription

    ### As a dispenser
    You can:
    * download an individual prescription from EPS
    * download a batch of prescriptions from EPS
    * verify a prescription's signature (subject to change)
    * return a prescription to EPS
    * submit a dispense notification to EPS
    * withdraw a dispense notification from EPS
    * submit a dispense claim
    * view a prescription's summary information

    You cannot currently use this API to:
    * view a prescription's detailed dispense history

    ## Who can use this API
    This API can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so. Make sure you have a valid use case before you go too far with your development. You must do this before you can go live (see ‘Onboarding’ below).

    ## Related APIs
    The following APIs also give access to the Electronic Prescription Service:
    - [Electronic Prescription Service - HL7 V3 API](https://data.developer.nhs.uk/dms/mim/4.2.00/Index.htm) - use this if you want to use functions that are not yet available on the FHIR API
    - [Signing Service](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/signing-service) - use this to digitally sign a prescription
    - [Prescription Tracker API](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/eps-tracker) - use this if you want a read-only interface to obtain information about a patient’s prescriptions

    The following APIs may be required when accessing the  Electronic Prescription Service:
    - [Personal Demographics Service - FHIR API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/personal-demographics-service-fhir) - use this to obtain patient data

    ## API status and roadmap
    The immediate priority of EPS development is to support the rollout of the next-gen FHIR APIs for primary care and secondary care prescribing and dispensing. Alongside this we will be working on integrating a new FHIR-compliant prescription tracker into the next gen APIs.
    
    ### Prescribing API
    This API supports two types of prescribing medication workflows
    
    #### Primary care medication workflow
    In a primary care medication workflow, the prescription is sent from a primary care service, such as a GP practice to a pharmacy. For this workflow, the API is in [beta](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#api-status), meaning:
    - it is available in integration and production
    - we might make breaking changes, but only if we cannot avoid it, and we will give advance notice

    #### Secondary care medication workflow
    In a secondary care medication workflow, the prescription is sent from a secondary care service, such as an NHS hospital to a pharmacy. For this workflow, the API is in [beta](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#api-status), meaning:
    - it is available in integration and production
    - we might make breaking changes, but only if we cannot avoid it, and we will give advance notice
    
    ### Dispensing API
    This API supports two types of dispensing medication workflows

    #### Community pharmacy workflow
    In a community pharmacy workflow, prescriptions can be released (downloaded) from Spine, updated, dispensed, and then claimed by the pharmacy. For this workflow, the API is in [alpha](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#api-status), meaning:
    - it is available for testing in the integration environment, but not for production use
    - we might make breaking changes, but only if we cannot avoid it, and we will give advance notice

    #### Homecare dispenser workflow
    In a homecare dispenser workflow, prescriptions can be released (downloaded) from Spine, updated, and dispensed by the dispenser. For this workflow, the API is in [alpha](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#api-status), meaning:
    - it is available for testing in the integration environment, but not for production use
    - we might make breaking changes, but only if we cannot avoid it, and we will give advance notice

    ### Roadmap
    To see our roadmap, or to suggest, comment or vote on features for this API, see our [interactive product backlog](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/?tag=eps-fhir-api).
    
    If you have any other queries, please [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).

    ## Technology
    This API conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir) global standard for health care data exchange.
    Specifically, it is aligned with [FHIR UK Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core), which is built on FHIR Release 4.

    You do not need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules. In particular:
    - resource names are capitalised and singular, for example `/Patient` not `/patients`
    - array names are singular, for example `line` not `lines` for address lines
    - data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an `extension` object

    ## Network access
    This API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).
    To use this API with [NHS smartcards](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/nhs-smartcards-for-developers) you do need an HSCN connection, although internet-facing alternatives are available.

    For more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).

    ## Security and authorisation
    ### User-restricted access
    The EPS APIs are mostly [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis),
    meaning we authenticate the end user. The only interaction that is not user-restricted is bulk releasing nominated prescriptions.

    ### Application-restricted access
    You can use this access mode whilst bulk releasing nominated prescriptions whilst dispensing. To use this access mode, use the [Application-restricted RESTful API - signed JWT authentication](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/application-restricted-restful-apis-signed-jwt-authentication) security pattern.

    ### Sandbox testing
    Our [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):

    * is for early developer testing
    * only covers a limited set of scenarios
    * is stateless, so it does not actually persist any updates
    * is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation

    For details of sandbox testing, or to try out the sandbox using our "Try this API" feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.

    ### Integration testing
    Our [integration test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing):

    * is for formal integration testing
    * is stateful, so persists updates
    * includes authorisation, with [smartcard](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/nhs-smartcards-for-developers) and non-smartcard options

    For more details see [integration testing with our RESTful APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing-with-our-restful-apis).

    ## Onboarding
    You need to get your software approved by us before it can go live with this API. We call this onboarding.
    We are hoping to make the onboarding process as lightweight and as self-service as possible. The onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so it’s worth planning well ahead.

    To begin the onboarding process please download and complete the [EPS use case form](https://nhs-prod.global.ssl.fastly.net/binaries/content/assets/website-assets/developer/electronic-prescription-service-fhir-api/eps-access-form-v1.0-org-short-name-yyyymmdd-1.docx) and email it to us at [epsonboarding@nhs.net](mailto:epsonboarding@nhs.net).

    ## Resources
    Use the [Digital Medicines Implementation Guide](https://simplifier.net/guide/DigitalMedicines) to assist with your integration.
    This is the FHIR specification for Digital Medicines starting with the assets required for an electronic prescription sent to the EPS.
    
    For further guidance on prescribing, see [EPS prescribing developer guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/developer-guides/eps-developer-guide).

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to send a prescription-order message to EPS.

        The effect of calling this endpoint depends on the type of the message, which is determined by the `MessageHeader` resource.
        To create a prescription, send a [prescription-order message](https://simplifier.net/guide/DigitalMedicines/prescription-order).
        The message must include a digital signature.

        Note that the `#prescription-order` in the URL has been added to distinguish this from the other operations which
        can be performed using the `$process-message` endpoint. It is not required in requests to the API.

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to verify a prescription's signature to ensure that the signature is valid, and that it matches the prescription it is attached to.
        This endpoint is expected to be used immediately after downloading prescriptions.
        Send the response message from the release endpoint to this endpoint.
        The signatures on these prescriptions will be verified.

        The endpoint will return a set of (up to 25) verify responses associated with the bundle of prescriptions sent to the endpoint for verification.

      summary: Return a downloaded prescription
      description: |
        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to return a downloaded prescription to Spine, so that another dispensing system can download it.

        The effect of calling this endpoint depends on the Task status.
        To return a downloaded prescription to EPS, send a Task with a status of `rejected`.
        For more information on how to create these messages, see [NHSDigital-Task](https://simplifier.net/guide/DigitalMedicines/NHSDigital-Task).

        Note that the `#return` in the URL has been added to distinguish this from the other operations which
        can be performed using the `Task` endpoint. It is not required in requests to the API.

      description: |
        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to send a dispense-notification message to EPS.

        The effect of calling this endpoint depends on the type of the message, which is determined by the `MessageHeader` resource.
        To mark a prescription as partially or fully dispensed, send a [dispense-notification message](https://simplifier.net/guide/DigitalMedicines/prescription-dispense).

        Note that the `#dispense-notification` in the URL has been added to distinguish this from the other operations which
        can be performed using the `$process-message` endpoint. It is not required in requests to the API.

      description: |
        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to withdraw a dispense-notification message, for example in the case that a prescription was marked as dispensed erroneously.

        The effect of calling this endpoint depends on the Task status.
        To withdraw a dispense-notification message from EPS, send a Task with a status of `in-progress`.
        For more information on how to create these messages, see [NHSDigital-Task](https://simplifier.net/guide/DigitalMedicines/NHSDigital-Task).

        Note that the `#withdraw` in the URL has been added to distinguish this from the other operations which
        can be performed using the `Task` endpoint. It is not required in requests to the API.

        This interaction is only available in the sandbox environment.
