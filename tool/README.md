# Electronic Prescription Service API Tool

This is a hosted site to assist with testing and tracking implemented features for the *Electronic Prescription Service FHIRÂ® API*.

Smartcard auth is enabled by default so when navigating to homepage and selecting login you will be redirected to authenticate with a smartcard.

If you don't have a smartcard you can navigate to `/change-auth` to select simulated auth instead

## Backend

The tool is configured against EPS environments so any created prescriptions will be created and persisted in the matching EPS environment

## Features
