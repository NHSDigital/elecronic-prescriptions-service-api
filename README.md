# electronic-prescription-service-api

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/NHSD-APIM/API%20Platform/_apis/build/status/NHSDigital.electronic-prescription-service-api?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/NHSD-APIM/API%20Platform/_build/latest?definitionId=7&branchName=master)

This is a RESTful HL7® FHIR® API specification for the *Electronic Prescription Service API*.

* `specification/` This [Open API Specification](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) describes the endpoints, methods and messages exchanged by the API. Use it to generate interactive documentation; the contract between the API and its consumers.
* `scripts/` Utilities helpful to developers of this specification.
* `proxies/` Apigee API Proxies
* `coordinator/` Deals with message translation and distribution to other services. Backend for the production EPS FHIR API.
* `models/` A common, single source of truth directory for requests, responses and schemas used by the various components of this solution.

Consumers of the API will find developer documentation on the [NHS Digital Developer Hub](https://emea-demo8-nhsdportal.apigee.io/).

## Development

### Requirements
* make
* jq
* nodejs + npm/yarn
* [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry)

### Install
```
$ make install
```

#### Pre-commit hooks
Some pre-commit hooks are installed as part of the install above to ensure you can't commit invalid spec changes by accident. A combination of these checks are also run in CI.

### Environment Variables
Various scripts and commands rely on environment variables being set. These are documented with the commands.

:bulb: Consider using [direnv](https://direnv.net/) to manage your environment variables during development and maintaining your own `.envrc` file - the values of these variables will be specific to you and/or sensitive.

### Make commands
There are further `make` commands that help alias some functionality during development.

#### Common commands
Common commands needed for development can be run by running the default `make` command. This outputs to `build.log` and runs the following targets:

 * `clean` -- Removes the output from the build and release commands
 * `install` -- Installs package dependencies for all components
 * `build` -- Outputs the FHIR R4 validated models and artifacts for the: specification, coordinator and apigee proxies into the corresponding `dist/` directories
 * `test` -- Performs quality checks including linting, licence checking of dependencies and unit/low level integration tests
 * `release` -- Pulls all the artifacts for the individual components together and arranges them in a format ready to deploy; used mainly by CI but useful to check the output matches expectations
   
#### Run commands
 * `run-specification` -- Serves a preview of the specification in human-readable format
 * `run-coordinator` -- Run the coordinator locally

All `run-*` make targets rely on the corresponding `build-*` make targets, the `build` make target will run all of these

Make `build-models` is a dependency for all other `build-*` targets, the `build` target will run all builds including this dependency

### Running tests
#### Unit and Integration tests
To run tests for the coordinator: while in the coordinator folder, run
```
npm t
```

#### End-to-end tests
In order for tests under the make target `test-integration-coordinator` to work, you must have built and be running the coordindator locally. In a seperate shell run:

```
make build
make run-coordinator
```

Once the coordinator is up and displaying the port number, in another shell run:

```
make test-integration-coordindator
```

To run all other tests locally (includes unit and low level integration tests): while in the root folder, run

```
make build
make test
```

### VS Code Plugins

 * [openapi-lint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mermade.openapi-lint) resolves links and validates entire spec with the 'OpenAPI Resolve and Validate' command
 * [OpenAPI (Swagger) Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=42Crunch.vscode-openapi) provides sidebar navigation


### Emacs Plugins

 * [**openapi-yaml-mode**](https://github.com/esc-emacs/openapi-yaml-mode) provides syntax highlighting, completion, and path help

### Speccy

> [Speccy](http://speccy.io/) *A handy toolkit for OpenAPI, with a linter to enforce quality rules, documentation rendering, and resolution.*

Speccy does the lifting for the following npm scripts:

 * `lint` -- Lints the definition
 * `resolve` -- Outputs the specification as a **single file**
 * `serve` -- Serves a preview of the specification in human-readable format

(Workflow detailed in a [post](https://developerjack.com/blog/2018/maintaining-large-design-first-api-specs/) on the *developerjack* blog.)

:bulb: The `resolve -i` command is useful when uploading to Apigee which requires the spec as a single file. The `-i` argument ensures that all `$ref`'s are replaced with the referenced file or internal object's content

### Caveats

#### Swagger UI
Swagger UI unfortunately doesn't correctly render `$ref`s in examples, so use `speccy serve` instead.

#### Apigee Portal
The Apigee portal will not automatically pull examples from schemas, you must specify them manually.

#### Platform setup
Successful deployment of the API Proxy requires:

 1. A *Target Server* named `ig3`
 2. A *Key-Value Map* named `eps-variables`, containing:
    1. Key: `NHSD-ASID`, Value: Accredited System ID (ASID) identifying the API Gateway

:bulb: For Sandbox-running environments (`test`) these need to be present for successful deployment but can be set to empty/dummy values.
