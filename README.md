# electronic-prescription-service-api

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/NHSD-APIM/API%20Platform/_apis/build/status/NHSDigital.electronic-prescription-service-api?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/NHSD-APIM/API%20Platform/_build/latest?definitionId=7&branchName=master)

This is a RESTful HL7® FHIR® API specification for the *Electronic Prescription Service API*.

* `specification/` This [Open API Specification](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) describes the endpoints, methods and messages exchanged by the API. Use it to generate interactive documentation; the contract between the API and its consumers.
* `sandbox/` This NodeJS application implements a mock implementation of the service. Use it as a back-end service to the interactive documentation to illustrate interactions and concepts. It is not intended to provide an exhaustive/faithful environment suitable for full development and testing.
* `scripts/` Utilities helpful to developers of this specification.
* `apiproxy/` The Apigee API Proxy
* `coordinator/` Deals with message translation and distribution to other services. Backend for the production EPS FHIR API.

Consumers of the API will find developer documentation on the [NHS Digital Developer Hub](https://emea-demo8-nhsdportal.apigee.io/).

## Development

### Requirements
* make
* jq
* nodejs + npm/yarn
* [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry)

### Install
```
$ make install
```

#### Pre-commit hooks
Some pre-commit hooks are installed as part of the install above to ensure you can't commit invalid spec changes by accident. A combination of these checks are also run in CI.

### Environment Variables
Various scripts and commands rely on environment variables being set. These are documented with the commands.

:bulb: Consider using [direnv](https://direnv.net/) to manage your environment variables during development and maintaining your own `.envrc` file - the values of these variables will be specific to you and/or sensitive.

### Make commands
There are `make` commands that alias some of this functionality:
 * `lint` -- Lints the spec and code
 * `build-spec` -- Outputs the specification as a **single file** into the `build/` directory
 * `run-spec-viewer` -- Serves a preview of the specification in human-readable format
 * `generate-examples` -- generate example objects from the specification
 * `validate` -- validate generated examples against FHIR R4
 * `run-coordinator` -- build and run the coordinator locally

### Running tests
#### Unit and Integration tests
To run tests for the sandbox: while in the sandbox folder, run
```
npm t
```
To run tests for the coordinator: while in the coordinator folder, run
```
npm t
```

#### End-to-end tests
To run e2e tests for the sandbox, you need to supply an environment. A `local` environment and an environment template are included under `tests/e2e/environments`.

In order for local tests to work, you must have the sandbox server running locally.

```
make run-sandbox
```

To run all local tests (includes unit and integration tests) for the sandbox: while in the root folder, run
```
make test
```

There is a template environment file available at `tests/e2e/environments/postman_environment.json.template` useful for configuring different testing environments (such as on the CI server).

The makefile sets defaults for the environment variables required for local testing, the CI server overrides these.

### VS Code Plugins

 * [openapi-lint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mermade.openapi-lint) resolves links and validates entire spec with the 'OpenAPI Resolve and Validate' command
 * [OpenAPI (Swagger) Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=42Crunch.vscode-openapi) provides sidebar navigation


### Emacs Plugins

 * [**openapi-yaml-mode**](https://github.com/esc-emacs/openapi-yaml-mode) provides syntax highlighting, completion, and path help

### Speccy

> [Speccy](http://speccy.io/) *A handy toolkit for OpenAPI, with a linter to enforce quality rules, documentation rendering, and resolution.*

Speccy does the lifting for the following npm scripts:

 * `test` -- Lints the definition
 * `publish` -- Outputs the specification as a **single file** into the `build/` directory
 * `serve` -- Serves a preview of the specification in human-readable format

(Workflow detailed in a [post](https://developerjack.com/blog/2018/maintaining-large-design-first-api-specs/) on the *developerjack* blog.)

:bulb: The `publish` command is useful when uploading to Apigee which requires the spec as a single file.

### Caveats

#### Swagger UI
Swagger UI unfortunately doesn't correctly render `$ref`s in examples, so use `speccy serve` instead.

#### Apigee Portal
The Apigee portal will not automatically pull examples from schemas, you must specify them manually.

### Postman Collection

`electronic-prescription-service-api-sandbox.json` must be kept in sync with the OAS and Sandbox manually.

Procedure:
 * Import the collection into Postman
 * Update requests and export the collection back into the repo
 * Re-generate the [Run in Postman button](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman-for-publishers/run-in-postman/creating-run-button/) Markdown button link and update the OAS

#### Platform setup

Successful deployment of the API Proxy requires:

 1. A *Target Server* named `ig3`
 2. A *Key-Value Map* named `eps-variables`, containing:
    1. Key: `NHSD-ASID`, Value: Accredited System ID (ASID) identifying the API Gateway

:bulb: For Sandbox-running environments (`test`) these need to be present for successful deployment but can be set to empty/dummy values.
