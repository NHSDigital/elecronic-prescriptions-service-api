              The short-form Prescription ID. 
              An example of how to generate a short-form Prescription ID can be found in [our repo](https://github.com/NHSDigital/electronic-prescription-service-api/blob/master/packages/tool/site/client/src/fhir/generatePrescriptionIds.ts). 
              It is to be formatted as follows:
                * The first 6 characters are a unique locally generated random number of 6 hexadecimal characters.
                * The next 6 characters is the unique ODS code for the practice. If shorter than 6 characters then it must be zero-padded up to 6 characters from the start of the ODS code. e.g. 0A12BC  
                * The next 5 characters are an incremental sequence number starting from 00000 to FFFFF back to zero, of 5 hexadecimal characters. If supporting multiple practices, a sequence number per practice is required.
                * The final character is calculated on the entire ID using ISO/IEC 7064 2003 MOD 37-2 standard.
              
    pattern: "/^[0-9a-fA-F]{6}-[0-9a-fA-F]{6}-[0-9a-fA-F]{5}[0-9a-zA-Z+]{1}"
